./korean add (words) , make sure to add a space between each word, otherwise it won't parse it properly
example: ./korean add 몰다 어디다 밤 고양 탕싱

the add will create a file and store the words inside of it, then if it encounters a word again it will take notice and increment your notice count.

---
./korean check

the check will display all words you should either put on known or on seen.

./korean -h or --help

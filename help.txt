./korean add (words) , make sure to add a space between each word, otherwise it won't parse it properly
example: ./korean add 몰다 어디다 밤 고양 탕싱

the add will create a file and store the words inside of it, then if it encounters a word again it will take notice and increment your notice count.

---
./korean check

the check will display all words you should either put on known or on seen.

---
./korean updateStatus

the updateStatus will update all words to sync with your korean immersion tool, kimchi reader (for example).
!!!only use this when you have actually put the words from the korean check on seen or known that it has told you to put on seen or known!!!
